In this Code Pattern, we will build a Plotly Dash application for users to perform interactive visual analytics on SpaceX launch data in real-time.

This dashboard application contains input components such as a dropdown list and a range slider to interact with a pie chart and a scatter point chart.

After visual analysis using the dashboard, we should be able to obtain some insights to answer the following five questions:

Which site has the largest successful launches? 
Which site has the highest launch success rate? 
Which payload range(s) has the highest launch success rate? 
Which payload range(s) has the lowest launch success rate? 
Which F9 Booster version (v1.0, v1.1, FT, B4, B5, etc.) has the highest launch success rate?
